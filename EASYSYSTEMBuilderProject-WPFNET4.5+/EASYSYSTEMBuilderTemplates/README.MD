## EASYBuilder Premade Templates
<sup>**For thinking, the development of tools and work with them worthy in the 21st century**</sup>

Pre-prepared templates are used to easily create a new agenda.
Even if there are only a few of them, they are fully sufficient to create complex systems of more or less all types, not only IS Systems - for which 4 templates are enough, but also Special Systems, Media Systems, Management / BI, and many others.
The system is nothing more than a list of very frequently repeated forms.

And you simply click on the graphic builder, which is part of Visual Studio. And that's the entire development of the system.
Here is a list of prepared templates in the system for more than n IS SYSTEM

**SystemTemplates - Media Templates**
* TemplateListViewPage - Displays only the DataList. For example access history, Detailed form is not even needed

* TemplateListPage - displays the DataList and the Detailed form both for displaying the list and editing the record. That is, the most common template where you just edit the fields according to the table.

* TemplateListPageWithSubViewPage - displays the DataList and Detail form + additional DataList sub items. For example, the current exchange rate for currency. So it is a system type of Template

* TemplateListPageWithSubPage - displays a DataList and a Detail Form + another DataList with a Detail Item Form. For example Invoice - Header + Items. And with these templates you can write, for example, the entire SAP.
