### LOW/NO/FULL code EXTREMELY EASY TO DEVELOP ANY SYSTEM
<sup>**For thinking, the development of tools and work with them worthy in the 21st century**</sup>

#### The development of FRONTEND as an entire IS system as you do not know it - only 3 choices are enough

     Logic - everything in the database is a LIST (list of invoices)
-> This may or may not have a DETAIL (list of items)
|| OR it needs to be just settings, i.e. Detail (program settings, video processing, etc.)

And the result can be a system that SAP or anyone else can only dream of.
Almost like tennis, you can publish one table after another, and by evening you have a small system.

## DEFINITION OF 3 layer SYSTEM and necessary components
> Database - place for DATA
> Backend Server - A service that securely conveys data to applications
> Frontend/User Application - A nice application to easily work with data
> Print support - creation and printing of any reports

### START in 1 day you will start your new system in three steps


---
**Development in EASYDATACenter** UNIVERS RESTFULL/SOCKET BACKEND SERVER in three user steps

* Create any database Table. Use the TemplateList Template
        and just insert your boxes into it. Remember Indexes, Foreign Keys, or look at already existing tables or consult with me. It IS for a few minutes

* You export the tables as a model using the prepared CMD command to the BACKEND project
    [ EntityFramework 6 ] command: Scaffold-DbContext "Server=IP;Database=DB;User ID=USER;Password=PW;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir DBModel
    done - the entire database is defined in the Backend server
   

* From existing calls, e.g. UserList, copy and rename the new API call for the new table [GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE]
    COPY file -> PASTE file -> Rename to new API for example: /skladList and Build&Run
    Done, the API Server is WAITING at http://vaseip/skladList for your call and deployment at the client, in the company, anywhere

**Development in EASYBuilder** Modern WINDOWS XP+ thin application or system in three user steps

* You copy the table definition from the model created in the BACKEND project to the FRONTEND project
    COPY Class from BE Model -> PASTE into FE application -> add new APIURL

* Select the template you want, there are primarily 3 -> rename it, edit the form and connect it to the MAINMENU
    so you set the WHERE to search, COPY/PASTE boxes, write Translation in the dictionary and copy the connection to the MAINMENU
    done - the result is a new form with complete user control

* Build&Run - you check the work one after the other, because typos are part of us, aren't they
    the full logging option slaps you in detail where the error is or HURRY GOES
    Done, the Application is WAITING for your work or deployment at the client, in the company, anywhere

**Development of Press Reports in FYIREPORTING**

* You simply copy the existing DATALIST/DETAIL report and open it in the editor
    Rename to the new name of your table.

* You edit your SQL SELECT and Test it, the parameters are already set ID/SEARCH/CONNECT
    Ideally in MSSQLMS or HEIDYSQL or something and debug it there. Remember everything is just a LIST or Detail.
    done - and you have the correct data that you just arrange for printing in the form.

* And you import into the system in the REPORTING list menu, where you set the required link to APIURL/SEARCH/ID
    Done, the press kit is WAITING for your work or deployment at the client, in the company, anywhere
