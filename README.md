New in the menu "Absolutely unique EASY SYSTEM BUILDER"
absolutely easy to create a 3-tier system (ANY DB, BACKEND-SERVER, FRONTEND-KLIENT) with excel knowledge
Just create a Table for Data and a Form, all in graphic designers
So you literally click on the system, 1 table every day = sales system with orders and offers per month
And that's not all, by any chance.
It doesn't have to be only a data system, but also a multimedia one without any problem, for cutting videos, working with photos or 3D
or even a CONTROL SYSTEM for machine control (Currently SIEMENS PLC is supported), or any other Hardware
after delivery of specifications.
Or the Control system, Backup, DataWarehouse, Controlling, BI OLAP, Flow Processes,
Production, Information or business touch Terminals. IT CAN ALSO BE USED ONLY AS AN EXTENSION OR CONNECTION OF SYSTEMS

The starting cost for the core is only 10,000 CZK / 400 Euro, and you can try it yourself or order cheaply
what you want to add there. Don't bow down to the system, GET A CUSTOMIZED SYSTEM.
For idea:
  - invoicing system with OBJ+NAB+MULTI BRANCHES, WAREHOUSE, CHECKOUT - 14 DAYS
  - implementation of a touch terminal in production for work reports - 4 DAYS
  - A system for hotels including room agency, invoicing and orders is currently being created - 1 MONTH
  - Free updates, 1 development for all clients via shared project agendas in code
 
  Unlimited users, unlimited printing, unlimited options, tutorials, tips, tricks, advice,
  Prepared for all types of systems and terminals for MS WINDOWS
