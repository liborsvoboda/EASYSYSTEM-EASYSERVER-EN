### Marketing materials - We just click and half the job is done
<sup>**For thinking, the development of tools and work with them worthy in the 21st century**</sup>

EASY SYSTEM Builder & EASY DATA Center is the perfect solution for:
> Fast MS Modern system with 3-layer technology right from the start
> Standalone cross-platform backend server for websites, systems, etc. with REST API/WebSocket
> For any simple development of any HW/SW DATA/Control system and much more



The basic logic of the solution includes 2 main separate projects:

> WPF FRONTEND system processor for WINDOWS XP+ = User application - FRONTEND
> ASP NET CORE 6 (LTS) UNIVERSAL MULTIPLATFORM BACKEND SERVER for demanding systems

  and are intended for:

> for companies with an IT worker
> for IT developers
> for DataCentra
> for secondary schools
> for the second grade of elementary school
> for do-it-yourselfers

> **The possibilities far exceed the normal requirements of companies**
> **No exaggeration The challenge for these solutions to push the limits would be automatic air traffic control** = So add Addons


**You can confirm this by reading the Information for Starting Development, which is a must
teach everyone with a little interest.**

Processing difficulty has been moved to the core of the system, and if you follow the simple conditions of creation, you will soon fulfill the password: **NEW AGENDA EVERY DAY**

### System Philosophy, Structures of systems and their division
***Click is way How to Develop Robust System*** - Is it possible? Yes
> The solution was built on existing standards for 3-Layers SW Technology without exceptions

> And there came a necessary exception - not just a unique rule - So List or Settings?

> LOW/NO code Knowledge is a Prerequisite for developing a maximum global system rule core sufficient to create a Custom System
  
> In the Database Management Software, you need to click on the database model
> and all the others are just copying parts of the automatically generated structure from the databases
> simple connection with prepared TABLE/API/FORM templates and
> Click again on the XAML graphical form for a new table (for example the invoice header table)
> Read Logis, Designing ideal systems and developing practice

### Implemented system logic and Development Procedure / Instructions
***Initial conditions of correct development - right at the beginning***

> The system has fixed rules for object names for automatic background work
as a standardized model.
> And that is the magic of the system.
> Read at least: 'What you need to know to start development' and follow the mentioned few rules.

**A couple of rules actually mean 2: the name of the table already in the Database and the namespace 'Pages' for Agendas**

**It's that simple. You will use Database management for Table Development
MSSQLMS or for MYSQL for example HEIDYSQL and you click on the table.
Then you copy the Class 'CLASS' table to the Frontend
and just click the XAML Form in the Designer again. Then Add to menu and Dictionary and you're done.**

There are templates in the systems for all levels of development.
In the Development Code Specifications, various tricks and more complicated variables are listed
i.e. also only ready for Copying.

you have written
Read the model and view the templates. If they are clear to you, you can develop.

> The logic is already set from the Database. So if you start with the Table Template, you've won.
> The result is absolutely clean, fast code where every process is centralized by the right engine.
> If the Open community takes off, there will be more agendas for free.
  
> Example: Database table format: ExampleTableList
   the end of the Table name must contain the word "Sheet"
   
> And then you automatically copy these rules to the entire system
> A simple introduction is ready for Start. For Development immediately

> The easiest way is to copy existing objects of the same level and you will automatically take over the correct settings. You will soon find out that most of the systems are not
nothing but one big copy.

### Backend UNIVERSAL Super Server -

***Easy intuitive development*** - is a universal Backend Server for every application with standard RESTFULL/SOCKET communication. (WSDL will be supported within 1 year)

Existing problematic servers can be replaced with this engine in an extremely short time.
The entire model of an existing database can be automatically attached with a single command

Paradox - in practice it's even easier than creating a new one -> Now you take the existing logic from the database without fail

And further Apply only templates for all tables/views/procedures in the database to publish data through Complex API logic that is implemented in the core of the solution
   
Backend server development depends on the knowledge of creating database tables/indexes/keys between tables
       
The server therefore only ensures communication, variability according to the most modern standards, which in turn gives you the ability to connect any systems at the data level in the base itself, minimize demands, maximize the correctness of the connection, offer use for different clients at the same time with support for all databases commonly used today
